# Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Email spam is a growing issue that affects productivity and security through phishing, fraud, and malicious links. This project focuses on identifying and classifying spam emails using machine learning techniques based on email content.

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available labeled email dataset containing spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The dataset was used for training and evaluation.

## What I Did
- Performed data preprocessing including text cleaning and tokenization
- Extracted relevant textual features from email content
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Built and evaluated a Random Forest classification model

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, MS Excel

## Results
- Achieved **97% accuracy** using Random Forest
- Successfully classified emails as Spam or Ham

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to email text data to accurately detect spam and improve email filtering systems.
